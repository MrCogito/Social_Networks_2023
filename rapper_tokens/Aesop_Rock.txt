lyric
bavitz
lyric
are
generally
seen
a
being
both
complex
and
abstract
while
others
dismiss
them
a
verbose
his
frequent
use
of
homonym
exacerbates
this
critic
state
that
the
use
of
word
can
be
so
detailed
that
it
becomes
difficult
to
determine
any
meaning
the
lyric
are
sometimes
inspired
by
event
which
have
occurred
in
bavitz
personal
life
and
are
thus
naturally
prone
to
subjective
interpretation
by
about
his
lyrical
style
in
an
interview
bavitz
responded
it
probably
because
it
not
the
most
accessible
music
in
the
world
it
may
pose
a
slight
challenge
to
the
listener
beyond
your
average
pop
song
i
no
genius
by
a
long
shot
but
these
song
are
not
nonsensical
that
pretty
preposterous
i
have
to
be
a
genius
to
pull
this
many
nonsensical
record
over
people
eye
it
not
exactly
fast
food
but
when
people
pretend
i
just
spewing
and
gibberish
i
ca
help
but
think
they
simply
have
listened
and
are
regurgitating
some
rumor
they
heard
about
me
even
if
it
not
laid
out
in
perfect
any
rap
have
to
be
an
idiot
to
not
at
least
grasp
a
few
thing
from
these
song
or
have
had
no
interest
in
pulling
anything
from
them

the
first
place
