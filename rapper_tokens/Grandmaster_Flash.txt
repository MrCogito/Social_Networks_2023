saddler
early

a
well
a
his

the
earliest
new
york
dj
scene
attending
party
set
up
by
early
luminary
like
dj
kool
herc
and
disco
king
mario
saddler
uncle
sandy
saddler
wa
a
featherweight
boxing
champion
innovation
grandmaster
flash
observed
the
style
of
the
smooth
transition
of
a
disco
dj
versus
the
transition
of
early
djing
he
chose
to
complete
his
study
with
the
former
grandmaster
flash
came
up
with
a
and
crossfader
technique
called
the
quick
mix
theory
in
doing
this
he
figured
out
a
mathematical
way
to
cut
paste
repeat
and
extend
a
very
minuscule
piece
of
an
existing
composition
this
innovation
took
place
in
two
place
in
the
bronx
the
first
location
wa
his
parent
house
dewey
ave
in
the
throggs
neck
project
of
the
bronx
the
completion
of
the
quik
mix
theory
wa
done
at
fox
street
in
the
hunt
point
area
of
the
bronx
the
quick
mix
theory
gave
birth
to
technique
such
a
cutting
scratching
and
transforming
backspin
technique
or
theory
new
york
dj
understood
that
grandmaster
flash
short
drum
break
technique
became
the
way
for
all
dj
to
play
a
quick
mix
dj
build
a
foundation
on
timing
this
particular
dj
art
form
gave
birth
to
human
being
having
a
clean
excellently
timed
extended
bed
of
music
to
speak
on
this
led
to
sampling
sampling
led
to
big
business
today
under
hip
hop
four
element
umbrella
this
record
sampling
technique
gave
birth
to
what
is
known
a
rap
where
the
emcee
or
rapper
verbally
tell
their
story
on
a
seamless
bed
of
addition
to
grandmaster
flash
technique
additional
item
were
needed
to
pull
this
off
these
item
were
felt
and
wax
paper
the
combination
of
these
two
material
cut
into
the
size
of
a
record
and
placed
on
the
turntable
at
that
time
referred
to
a
a
wafer
allowed
the
record
to
move
fluidly
the
end
result
of
that
wa
the
creation
of
what
we
today
call
the
slipmat
another
item
that
played
a
key
role
in
the
successful
implementation
of
the
quick
mix
theory
is
the
he
realized
that
the
stylus
came
in
two
class
elliptical
which
sounded
better
but
would
not
stay
in
the
groove
and
spherical
the
spherical
needle
although
making
the
song
sound
worse
would
stay
inside
the
groove
this
in
turn
allowed
flash
to
turn
the
vinyl
counterclockwise
to
at
the
top
of
the
break
punch
phrasing
or
clock
theory
this
technique
involved
isolating
very
short
segment
of
music
typically
horn
hit
and
rhythmically
punching
them
over
the
sustained
beat
using
the
mixer
scratching
although
the
invention
of
record
scratching
a
a
form
of
adding
to
the
musical
entertainment
is
generally
credited
to
grand
wizzard
theodore
grandmaster
flash
perfected
the
technique
and
brought
it
to
new
audience
scratching
along
with
punch
phrasing
exhibited
a
unique
aspect
of
party
djing
instead
of
passively
spinning
record
he
manipulated
them
to
create
new
music
