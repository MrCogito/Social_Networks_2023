a

express
that

he

off
the
back
of
the
train
on
the
last
car
for
a
thrill
ride
holding
on
to
nothing
but
the
door
knob
with
his
foot
barely
touching
the
platform
with
his
stunt
and
rebelliousness
it
led
to
one
of
the
most
defining
moment
in
silkski
s
life
his
mother
turned
him
over
to
the
state
his
mother
put
him
in
a
group
home
in
staten
island
mount
lorreto
mission
of
the
immaculate
virgin
eventually
silkski
left
the
group
home
and
moved
in
with
his
cousin
who
lived
in
the
roughest
area
of
jamaica
queen
while
in
jamaica
queen
silkski
along
with
others
contributed
to
the
negativity
of
queen
inner
city
street
although
he
lived
in
a
grimey
area
he
stood
out
with
his
extreme
tagging
graffiti
technique
and
style
of
dancing
which
led
him
to
be
nicknamed
kid
boogie
during
silkski
adolescence
and
preteen
year
he
wa
known
a
the
kid
with
the
sleepy
eye
people
around
him
would
call
him
sleepy
because
his
eye
use
to
droop
down
or
appear
a
if
he
wa
high
or
falling
asleep
but
at
the
age
of
he
decided
that
he
wanted
a
nickname
that
sounded
cool
or
slick
he
chose
the
name
silk
because
older
people
use
to
say
that
he
wa
smooth
a
silk
because
he
had
the
wavy
hair
smooth
talk
and
swagger
with
the
way
he
dressed
although
he
liked
the
name
slick
he
decided
to
go
with
silk
because
it
wa
cool
sounded
slick
and
at
the
time
wa
original
during
the
early
stage
of
hip
hop
emcee
and
graffiti
artist
were
giving
themselves
nickname
with
a
common
tag
at
the
end
which
wa
a
letter
of
the
alphabet
or
something
that
gave
that
individual
a
swagger
that
represented
a
form
of
expression
a
character
or
alto
ego
of
themselves
at
that
time
growing
up
he
would
frequently
wear
ski
jacket
ski
hat
beany
and
ski
goggles
because
of
the
cold
weather
in
new
york
which
in
turn
contributed
to
his
persona
and
ultimately
became
a
part
of
his
name
he
put
the
two
word
together
silk
and
ski
and
that
is
what
formed
the
name
