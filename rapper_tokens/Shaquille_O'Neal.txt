in

reached
career
point
becoming
the
player
in

history
to
accomplish
that
milestone
however
it
wa
the
first
season
in
career
that
his
scoring
average
dropped
below

career
low
and
disagreement
experienced
a
rough
start
for
the

averaging
career
low
in

diminished
a
he

appearance
ended
that

again
missed

streak
according
to
riley

he
wa
faking
the

during
a
practice
in

got
into
an
altercation
with
riley
over
the

jason

to

the
two
argued
with
poking
riley
in
the
chest
and
riley
slapping
his
finger
away
riley
soon
after
decided
to
trade
said
his
relationship
with
wade
wa
not
all
that
good
by
the
time
he
left

he
did

upbeat
in

ricky
davis
i
actually
on
a
team
again
riley
felt
wa
wrong
for
maligning
his
former
teammate
responded
with
an
expletive
toward
riley
whom
he
often
referred
to
a
the
great
pat
riley
while
playing
for
the
heat
credited
the
sun
training
staff
with
prolonging
his
career
they
connected
his
arthritic
toe
which
would
not
bend
to
the
alteration
of
his
jump
that
consequently
wa
straining
his
leg
the
trainer
had
him
concentrate
on
building
his
core
strength
flexibility
and
season
improved
for
who
averaged
point
rebound
and
block
through
the
first
half
game
of
the

leading
the

to
a
record
and
place
in

he
returned
to
the

emerged
a
along
with

bryant
on
february
scored
point
and
grabbed

his
career
game
beating
the
toronto
raptor
in
a
matchup
against
orlando
on
march
wa
outscored
by
magic
center
dwight
howard
i
really
too
old
to
be
trying
to
outscore
said
referring
to
the
then
howard
it
not
really
my
role
anymore
wa
most
of
the
night
i
like
to
play
people
my
whole
career
i
had
to
play
people
never
once
had
to
double
or
ask
for
a
double
but
it
cool
said
during
the
game
flopped
against
howard
magic
coach
stan
van
gundy
who
had
coached
with
the
heat
wa
very
disappointed
cause
know
what
it
like
let
stand
up
and
play
like
men
and
i
think
our
guy
did
that
tonight
responded
flopping
is
playing
like
that
your
whole
career
i
wa
trying
to
take
the
charge
trying
to
get
a
call
it
probably
wa
a
flop
but
flopping
is
the
wrong
use
of
word
flopping
would
describe
his
coaching
mark
madsen
a
lakers
teammate
of
for
three
year
found
it
amusing
since
everyone
in
the
league
try
to
flop
on
shaq
and
shaq
never
flop
back
in
a
interview
in
time
said
if
he
were
nba
commissioner
he
would
make
a
guy
have
to
beat
a
flop
and
get
call
and
be
nice
to
the
referee
and
kiss
as
on
march
talked
about
the
upcoming
game
against
the
rocket
and
yao
ming
it
not
going
to
be
so
do
even
try
that
say
with
an
incredulous
laugh
they
going
to
double
and
triple
me
like
everybody
else
i
rarely
get
to
play
yao
but
when
i
play
him
on
defense
it
just
going
to
be
me
down
there
so
do
try
to
make
it
a
yao
versus
shaq
thing
when
it
shaq
versus
four
other
guy
