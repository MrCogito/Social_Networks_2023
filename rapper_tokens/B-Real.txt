after

to
dj
muggs
by
julio
g
the
kday
mixmaster
and
sen
gained
interest
in
muggs
concept
of
an

ave
in
south
gate
the
group
wa

material

and
subsequent
release
while
working
on
their
first
album
developed
his
distinctive
nasal
rap
style
previously
he
had
rapped
with
something
like
his
normal
voice
but
dj
muggs
told
him
that
his
rap
delivery
wa
boring
and
warned
him
that
unless

changed
it
he
would
be
overshadowed
by
sen
dog
took
inspiration
from
hip
hop
pioneer
rammellzee
who
had
occasionally
rapped
in
a
voice
initially
saw
the
high
voice
a
a
silly
gimmick
but
wa
surprised
at
the
positive
feedback
he
got
for
his
new
style
and
decided
to
keep
going
with
hill
debut
album
wa
a
critical
and
commercial
hit
selling
million
copy
and
their
album
black
sunday
wa
an
even
bigger
hit
debuting
at
on
the
billboard
and
eventually
selling
million
copy
they
became
the
first
latin
rap
group
to
have
platinum
and
album
and
remain
the
latin
rap
group
of
all
time
in
a
interview
stated
fortunately
i
guess
the
fact
we
were
able
to
achieve
what
we
achieved
being
latino
but
without
really
exploiting
that
side
of
it
showed
like
a
whole
generation
behind
u
how
you
could
have
that
success
without
being
labeled
a
just
one
thing
because
back
in
the
day
when
you
were
labeled
a
latino
rapper
the
record
company
would
only
try
to
market
you
to
that
latin
which
did
really
exist
yet
so
yeah
it
feel
good
to
see
people
recognizing
u
a
some
of
the
pioneer
that
opened
the
door
for
a
lot
