album
the
storm
lucas
expressed
interest
on

on
the

sriracha
and
felt
that

and
tech
acquiesced
logic
wa
originally
slated

be
the
only
feature
on

spent
over
six
month
to
deliver
his
verse

hopped
on

track
to
offer
his

joyner
stated
that
when

back
he
could
tell
that
logic
wa
not

happy
about

being
on
the
track
once
he
heard
it
on

remix
of
future
mask
off
joyner
unhappy
by
the
work
logic
turned
in
after

nearly
half
a
year
to

addressed
the
disappointing
display
both

for
not
emulating
the
style
of
quick
flow
on
the
logic
hit
song
peaked
at
number
three
on

hot
joyner
lucas
immediately
took
offense
