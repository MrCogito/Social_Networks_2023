try
to
locate
the
shooter
saying
he
is
not
a
snitch
and
helping
the
police
would
probably
hurt
his
record
sale
he
stated
in
the
interview
because
with
the
type
of
business
i
in
it
would
definitely
hurt
my
business
and
the
way
that
i
wa
raised
i
just
do
do
that
i
wa
raised
differently
not
to
tell
it
about
business
but
it
still
also
a
code
of
ethic
when
asked
by
anderson
cooper
if
he
would
tell
the
police
if
a
serial
killer
wa
living
next
to
him
replied
i
would
probably
move
but
would
not
inform
the
police
later
issued
an
apology
for
his
comment
calling
them
an
error
in
judgement
where
i
come
from
once
word
get
out
that
you
cooperated
with
the
police
that
only
make
you
a
bigger
target
of
criminal
violence
that
is
a
dark
reality
in
so
many
neighborhood

not
saying
it
right
but
it
reality

not
unfounded
