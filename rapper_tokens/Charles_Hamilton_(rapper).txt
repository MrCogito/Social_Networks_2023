personal
struggle
and
arrest
during
an
interview
on
july
hamilton
announced
that
he
had
checked
himself
into
a
psychiatric
hospital
he
stated
my
stay
here
is
like
identical
to
my
stay
in
the
industry
a
far
a
being
the
new
guy
in
here
having
to
deal
with
politics
and
people
trying
to
control
you
the
critic
would
have
to
be
the
doctor
and
the
round
so
you
can
say
this
is
like
an
experiment
to
see
if
the
industry
is
really
like
an
asylum
or
if
i
wa
the
one
bugging
some
say
the
industry
is
like
high
school
but
it
just
like
a
mental
hospital
all
i
wanted
to
do
and
still
want
to
do
is
make
music
he
explained
it
got
to
the
point
where
i
started
talking
in
rhyme
all
the
time
even
in
just
regular
conversation
and
music
just
became
me
so
i
thought
it
be
a
good
idea
if
i
checked
into
the
hospital
just
to
get
my
mind
right
after
being
released
on
august
hamilton
discussed
in
an
interview
his
stay
at
the
psychiatric
hospital
and
why
upon
filming
of
his
release
in
a
video
why
he
wa
in
a
wheelchair
stating
the
reason
im
in
a
wheelchair
is
because
i
have
sharp
pain
since
i
wa
in
the
hospital
and
a
little
bit
before
he
said
i
have
sharp
pain
when
im
walking
and
literally
i
want
to
collapse
but
i
ca
i
have
to
continue
to
walk
so
my
right
leg
ha
been
acting
kinda
funny
i
still
have
a
little
bit
of
mobility
i
can
still
stand
up
in
the
booth
but
i
rather
the
mobility
of
my
leg
be
jeopardized
than
my
musicality
be
jeopardized
at
any
given
point
of
time
that
december
hamilton
wa
arrested
in
cleveland
ohio
after
assaulting
an
officer
hamilton
would
later
post
bail
for
and

referred
for
psychiatric
treatment
during
a
interview
hamilton
would
go
more
into
detail
about
what
happened
saying
that
he
knew
better
than
to
punch
a
cop
hamilton
had
just
crashed
his
father
girlfriend
car
which
he
took
without
permission
or
a
driver
license
unharmed
he
wandered
to
quicken
loan
arena
where
he
began
playing
what
he
say
wa
an
imaginary
basketball
with
exiting
cavalier
fan
this
cop

and
wa
like
what

crossed
him
