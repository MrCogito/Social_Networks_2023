that
me
and
herc
were
to
what
nicky
barnes
and
frank

to
drug
decline
in
popularity
and
later
year
a
other
nascent
group
patterned
themselves
after
herc
and
la
rock
and
improved
on
their
formula
the
popularity
of
herc
and
the
herculoids
began
to
wane
a
early
a
kool
herc
wa
stabbed
at
a
party

pool
hall
but
they
had
already
moved
their
friend
down
south
to
avoid
a
confrontation
after
this
incident
la
rock
decided
to
step
away
from
hip
hop
and
let
the
younger
generation
move
in
since
he
had
a
long
run
lasting
several
year
of
being
on

of
the
bronx
hip
hop
scene

those
guy
were
like
just
weren

anymore
in

to
other
early
bronx

wa
released
by

a
part
of
a
special
