carried
out
by

to
avenge
a
beating
by
shakur
hour
earlier
and
that
wallace
had
paid
for
the
gun
los

time
editor
mark
duvoisin
wrote
that
philip
story
ha
withstood
all
challenge
to
it
accuracy
and
remains
the
definitive
account
of
the
shakur
slaying
wallace
family
denied
the
report
producing
document
purporting
to
show
that
he
wa
in
new
york
and
new

at
the
time
however
the

time
called
the

inconclusive
stating

indicating
that

wrote
half
the

around
and
laid
down
a
ref
shorthand
for
a

vocal
the
equivalent
of

but
nothing
indicates
when
