time
ben
ratliff
wrote
that
rakim
unblustery
rapping
developed
the
form
beyond
the
rhythm
of
schoolyard
rhyme
while
many
rapper
developed
their
technique
through
improvisation
rakim
wa
one
of
the
first
to
demonstrate
advantage
of
a
writerly
style
a
with
for
instance
his
pioneering
use
of
internal
rhyme
and
multisyllabic
rhyme
unlike
previous
rapper
such
a
ll
cool
j
and
who
delivered
their
vocal
with
high
energy
rakim
employed
a
relaxed
stoic
delivery
according
to
mtv
we
been
used
to
mc
like
run
and
dmc
chuck
d
and
leaping
on
the
mic
shouting
with
energy
and
irreverence
but
rakim
took
a
methodical
approach
to
his
microphone
fiending
he
had
a
slow
flow
and
every
line
wa
blunt
mesmeric
rakim
relaxed
delivery
result
from
his
jazz
influence
he
had
played
the
saxophone
and
wa
a
john
coltrane
and
critic
often
credit
rakim
with
creating
the
overall
shift
from
the
more
simplistic
old
school
flow
to
more
complex
flow
kool

say
any
emcee
that
came
after
had
to
study
rakim
just
to
know
what
to
be
able

and
that
wa
the

from
that
point
on
anybody
emceeing
wa

to
focus
on
their
flow
kool
moe
dee
explains
that
before
rakim
the
term
wa
widely
used
rakim
is
basically
the
inventor
of

came
along
it
wa
called

it
wa
called

but
it
wa
called
flow
rakim
created
flow
he
add
that
while
rakim
upgraded
and
popularized
the
focus
on
flow
he
did
invent
the
word

covered
his
own
rapping
skill
and
lyrical
superiority
over

comment
that
the
majority
of
his

rakim
for
his
complex
internal
