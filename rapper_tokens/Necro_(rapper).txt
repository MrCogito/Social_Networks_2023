commented
i
decided
to
leave
the
tour
collectively
with
my
manager
and
booking
agent
both
tour
organizer
because
we
felt
the
tour
demographic
wa
not
receiving
hip
hop
well
i
wa
facing
hostile
disrespectful
crowd
and
had
lot
of
glass
bottle
thrown
at
me
it
wa
making
a
lot
of
people
in
the
tour
crew
nervous
and
there
wa
concern
someone
might
get
hurt
not
me
it
wa
also
being
suggested
that
maybe
i
tone
down
my
live
show
and
not
antagonize
the
already
antagonistic
crowd
i
could
roll
with
that
a
it
not
my
style
i
wa
holding
back
enough
a
it
is
but
there
is
a
line
all
the
band
on
the
tour
loved
u
and
everyone
behind
the
scene
knew
we
displayed
major
heart
and
never
once
got
fazed
by
the
hostility
we
finished
every
show
according
to
our
minute
time
slot
i
will
make
one
thing
clear
for
the
hater
we
never
got
booed
off
the
stage
not
once
yes
a
ton
of
emo
kid
booed
u
at
every
show
but
we
had
a
minute
set
every
night
and
we
stayed
on
stage
for
every
minute
of
it
and
we
represented
every
show
had
at
least
necro
fan
in
the
pit
tearing
it
up
and
our
meet
and
greets
were
incredible
it
just
a
shame
these
little
kid
are
so
the
majority
of
the
hate
wa
coming
from
mop
top
emo
who
have
no
clue
who
the
originator
of
metal
are
and
did
respect
my
in

chant
to

for
the
opportunity
to
prove
i
can
represent
in
