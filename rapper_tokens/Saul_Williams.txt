the
point
of

wa
he
said
i
making
this
up
i
have
no
idea
but
here
we
go
i
think
that
it
would
be
to
express
to
share
to
relieve
to
explore
for
me
poetry
offer
some
what
of
a
cathartic
experience
i
am
able
to
move
through
emotion
and
emotional
experience
particularly
you
know
difficulty
in
all
the
thing
that
i
may
face
whether
that
is
with
an
industry
or
a
loved
one
or
whomever
there
need
to
be
an
infiltration
process
like
you
have
a
window
open
over
there
that
is
the
purpose
of
poetry
it
is
the
window
that
open
that
allows
some
air
in
some
other
insight
some
other
possibility
so
we
can
explore
all
that
we
feel
all
that
we
think
but
with
the
space
to
see
more
than
what
we
know
because
there
is
so
much
more
than
we
know
if
i
did
open
myself
to
the
possibility
of
the
unknown
then
i
would
be
lost
