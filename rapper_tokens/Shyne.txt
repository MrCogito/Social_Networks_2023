shyne
said
the
entire
process
wa
devastating
ten
hour
of
incarceration
is
ten
hour
too
much
so
for
a
human
being
to
be
animalized
for
ten
year
there
is
no
quick
fix
to
that
it
like
being
shot
by
an
assailant
and
you
are
running
away
for
your
life
you
did
even
realize
you
got
shot
in
your
leg
because
you
are
running
on
adrenaline
it
not
until
you
get
to
a
place
of
safety
that
you
realize
you
have
a
hole
in
your
leg
and
you
collapse
you
ca
stand
up
and
that
wa
that
experience
wa
for
me
when
i
came
out
i
did
even
realize
how
wounded
and
devastated
i
wa
because
i
numbed
myself
to
the
pain
and
destruction
that
i
suffered
i
remember
my
mother
used
to
come
and
see
me
on
the
visit
floor
my
mother
could
look
at
me
she
would
start
to
shake
and
she
would
go
off
the
floor
and
go
to
the
bathroom
i
could
process
that
because
if
i
cried
in
front
of
her
then
that
would
make
her
life
go
to
shamble
if
i
cried
in
front
of
the
prison
guard
they
would
think
that
i
wa
weak
so
i
go
back
to
the
yard
and
lift
some
weight
smoke
a
cigar
and
act
like
nothing
happened
when
you
come
out
from
that
how
do
you
recover
how
do
you
put
back
your
life
