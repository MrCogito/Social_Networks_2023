to
phone
carroll
who
had
gone
to

two
hour
earlier
and
missed
all
his
call
carroll
said
my
picture
wa
in
the
boston
herald
talking
about
what
i
wa
doing
with
my
music
i
woke
up
one
afternoon
and
i
had
missed
phone
call
they
called
me
in
to
do
an
audition
turned
out
i
had
to
do
five
audition
originally
carroll
wa
sought
after
for
the
role
of
cheese
but
affleck
changed
his
mind
and
wanted
him
for
the
bigger
part
of
the
gangster
bubba
rogowski
carroll
explained
i
thought
i
wa
going
to
get
the
role
because
they
took
so
long
to
get
back
to
me
but
it
turn
out
ben
wa
just
convincing
the

to
take
a
chance
on
me

my
lack
of
acting
experience
i
wa
in
recording
with
la
coka

reasoning
by
saying
it
s
really
great
to
hire
people
with

have
developed
expectation
