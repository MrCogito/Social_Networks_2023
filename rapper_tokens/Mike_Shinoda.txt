i

probably
in

i
realized
that
there
wa
a
difference
between
japanese

that
important
to
realize
it
not
the
same
thing
and
then
eventually
with
linkin
park
i
toured
in
japan
i
been
there
now
i
think
four
time
i
remember
the
first
time
i
went
how
familiar
it
seemed
just
getting
out
of
the
plane
it
smelled
like
my
aunt
house
in
the
airport
it
smelled
like
japan
i
do
know
if
anybody
else
even
noticed
it
but
i
walked
out
of
the
plane
and
thought
this
is
definitely
familiar
to
me
did
even
see
anything
yet
and
then
going
to
tokyo
osaka
kyoto
nagoya
you
just
recognize
thing
about
the
way
people
act
the
small
thing
that
people
do
such
a
how
you
grab
a
piece
of
paper
there
are
thing
that
are
more
obvious
like
taking
somebody
business
card
with
two
hand
you
do
do
that
in
the
state
when
i
saw
somebody
do
that
i
went
oh
yeah
my
uncle
always
doe
that
you
know
there
are
little
thing
that
culturally
come
from
japan
but
they
also
exist
in
japanese
american
culture
and
it
made
me

like
the
connection
wa
there

of
had
realized
how
much
of
it
wa
there
