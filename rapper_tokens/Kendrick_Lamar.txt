the
midst

a
contradiction
everything

u
way
beyond

he
continued
by
noting
when
i
say
the
president

then
you
definitely
know
there
something
else
out
there
pushing
the
button
they
could
do
whatever
they
want
to
we
all
puppet
lamar
retracted
his
statement
several
day
before
the
election
following
swift
backlash
he
told
mtv

i
think
we

put
money
back
in
our
community
and
show
these

a
vocal
advocate

the
black
life
matter
movement

alright
serf
a
the
movement
unofficial
anthem
he
ha
argued
that
the

is
the
biggest
record
in
the
world
because
of
how
it
impacted
others
you
might
not
have
heard
it
on
the
radio
all
day
but
you
seeing
it
on
the
news
and
you
seeing
it
in
community
and
people
felt
it
alright
and
it
performance
at
the
bet
award
wa
heavily
criticized
by
fox
news
and
conservative
journalist
geraldo
rivera
who
claimed
it
sends
exactly
the
wrong
message
and
is
why
i
say
that
hip
hop
ha
done
more
damage
to
young
african
american
than
racism
in
recent
year
responding
to
his
remark
lamar
stressed
that
hip
hop
is
not
the
problem
our
reality
is
the
problem
of
the
situation
rather
than
going
out
here
and
doing
the
murder
myself
i
want
to
express
myself
in
a
positive
light
the
same
way
other
artist
are
doing

where
they
discussed
topic
concerning

inner
city
the
problem
the
solution
and
furthermore
embracing
the
youth
both
being
aware
that
mentoring
save
life
prior

wa
lamar
how
much
a
dollar
cost
the
meeting
wa
documented
in

and
obama
my
brother
keeper
challenge

lamar
shared
in

that
he
looked
to
obama
in
the

light
that

these
day
before
adding
we
tend
to
forget
that
people
who
attained
a
certain
position
are
human
despite
damn
being
conceived
during
the
presidential
election
and
released
in
the
beginning
of
donald
trump
presidency
lamar
barely
spoke
about
trump
on

is
like
beating
a
dead
horse
we
already
know
what
it
is
are
we
gon
na
keep
talking
about
it
or
are
we
gon
na
take
action

did
call
trump
election
a
complete
mindfuck
while
speaking
to
touré
for
and
explained
that
the
key
difference
between
him
and
obama
are
moral
dignity
principle
and
common
sense
how
can
you
follow
someone
who
doe
know
how
to
approach
someone
or
speak
to
them
kindly
and
with
compassion
and
sensitivity
