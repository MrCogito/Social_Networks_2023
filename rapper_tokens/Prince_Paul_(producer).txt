brian
coleman
book
check
the
technique
paul
reflected
on
his
work
with
de
la
soul
by
saying
if
there
wa
ever
a
sign
of
the
existence
of
god
de
la
soul
would
be
that
proof
to
me
i
never
had
such
a
perfect
fit
in
any
other
production
situation
in
russell
simmons
gave
prince
paul
an
imprint
under
his
def
jam
label
however
the
only
album
it
take
a
nation
of
sucker
to
let
u
in
by
resident
alien
wa
never
officially
released
it
is
available
a
an
unofficial
release
which
is
different
to
a
with
frukwan
of
stetsasonic
too
poetic
of
brother
grimm
and
the
rza
of
clan
prince
paul
formed
the
group

recorded
a
demo
together
in

foot
deep
in
on
gee
street
record
before
signing
a
deal
with
gee
street
wanted
to
release
the
album
on
ruthless
record
paul
flew
to
los
angeles
to
have
a
meeting
with
and
jerry
heller
but
wa
unimpressed
with
the
contract
and
declined
after
the
group
signed
to

paul
estimated
that
it
took
them
about
six
month
to
complete
the
paul
also
contributed
to
several
other
project
during
this
time
period
he
produced
three
song
for
boogie
down
production
album
sex
and
violence
though
later
expressed
frustration
that
the
group
released
the
album
before
he
had
finalized
and
polished
those
track
in
paul
and
teo
macero
collaborated
to
produce
the
solo
debut
from

dying
slowly
additionally
paul
joined
force
with
amityville
rapper
superstar
to
launch
a
supergroup
called
horror
city
paul
produced
a
horror
city
album
but
proved
unable
to
successfully
market
the
album
to
any
record
label
ultimately
paul
decided
to
horror
city
a
a
free
download
in
during
the
early
recording
session
for
stake
is
high
de
la
soul
and
prince
paul
decided
to
part
way
although
paul
wa
not
involved
in
the
making
of
the
album
he
ha
praised
it
in
several
interview
once
saying
i
wa
going
through
a
serious
transition
period
in
my
life
when
that
album
dropped
i
wa
trying
to
figure
out
the
next
thing
i
wa
going
to
do
i
wa
going
through
a
custody
case
for
my
son
and
i
wa
running
out
of
money
there
were
a
lot
of
thing
going
on
at
the
time
and
in
a
sense
that
album
pulled
me
through
everything
after
splitting
from
de
la
soul
paul
released
two
solo
album
in
the
following
year

featured
a
wide
range
of
rapper
including
big
daddy
kane
xzibit
kool
keith
and
everlast
when
paul
wa
recording
psychoanalysis
he
thought
his
career
wa
over
and
had
a
hard
time
finding
people
who
wanted
to
be
involved
with
the
project
many
of
the
vocal
were
provided
by
friend
of
his
from
outside
the
music
industry
year
later
he
recalled
thinking
some
people
might
get
about
it
but
so
what
it
probably
the
last
record
i
make
anyway
during
the
recording
of
beautiful
night
manic
psychopath
the
song
is
very
dark
and
deal
with
date
rape
racism
and
violence
according
to
paul
he
originally
proposed
the
idea
for
a
prince
among
thief
to
russell
simmons
in
the
early
but
simmons
wa
not
interested
while
describing
his
goal

tried
to
use

from
various
film
a
inspiration
on
a
prince
among
thief
paul
also
repurposed
some
of
the

encompasses
a
range
of
genre
relying
heavily
on
past

from
a
prince

and
combining
them
with
lighthearted
skit
about

paul
spoke
openly
in
an
interview
about
the
possibility

after
maseo
had
made
some
public
comment
about
a
reunion
in
the
interview
paul
state
that
he
asked
the
member
of
de
la
soul
to
work
on
a
new
album
on
and
off
since
though
he
wanted
to
do
a
reunion
at
one
time
it
seemed
in
the
interview
he
had
moved
past
the
idea
partially
because
of
the
far
more
restrictive
sampling
law
that
exist
today
he
said
it
nice
to
think
about
it
but
i
kind
of
like
where
we
left
it
there
would
be
so
many
expectation
for
me
to
do
another
de
la
record
i
do
think
i
could
really
live
up
to
it
especially
in
a
day
and
age
where
i
ca
openly
sample
like
that

of
his
favorite
piece
of
vintage

credit
for
having
a
unique
sound
saying
even
though
it
big
and
bulky
nothing
sound
like
that
it
pretty
flexible
it
easy
to
work
and
it
easy
to
truncate
your
sample

get
thing
tight
when
you
look
at
all
this
new
technology

sound
very
sterile

now
some
of
