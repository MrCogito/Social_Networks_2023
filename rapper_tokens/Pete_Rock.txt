reflective
da
two
from

soul
survivor
album
in
they
avoided
entertaining
request

went
on
a
short
international
tour
culminating
in
their
show
at
london
jazz
cafe
however
soon
after
this
they
declined
to
comment
any
further
on
the
new
album
which
never
materialized
although
smooth
did
make
three
separate
appearance
on
soul
survivor
ii
eventually
smooth
would
confirm
rumor
of
a
rift
in
an
interview
with
in
which
he
appeared
angry
and
frustrated
with
his
former
partner
saying
i
did
ask
him
to
be
a
superhero
and
i
not
the
problem
in
an
interview
taken
in
december
rock
ruled
out
any
further
collaboration
with
smooth
but
stated
that
he
hold
no
grudge
against
his
former
partner
musical
style
production
pete
rock
creates
beat
from
sample
the
majority
of
which
are
taken
from
obscure
r
b
funk
and
jazz
record
this
paying
true
homage
to
the
black
american
musical
tradition
that
are
the
foundation
and
origin
of
music
early
on
in
his
career

moving
onto
using
the
his
production
pete
rock
tends
to
use
the
sample
a
palette
for
his
beat
chopping
cutting
the
sample
into
smaller
part
filtering
altering
the
frequency
of
the
sample
and
layering
several
sample
often
within
the
same
song
while
this
technique
wa
applied
long
before
rock
on
de
la

three

distinctive
for
the
way
in
which
he

achieve
a
hazy
droning
effect
he
is
also
noted
for
his
resonant
basslines

sample
and
gritty
sounding
drum
his
beat
often
sound
a
though
they
were
being
played
from
an
old
vinyl
record
he
sample
many
of
his
sound
straight
off
these
record
he
frequently
recorded
at
greene
recording
in
manhattan
having
liked
the
equalizer
that
wa
used
there
which
gave
many
of
his
production
a
trait
of
his
more
so
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
career
is
the
way
he
us
horn
sample
to
supplement
his
groove
on
they
reminisce
over

short
instrumental
excerpt
completely
different
from

these
are
widely
regarded
a
