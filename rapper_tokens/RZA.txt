up
and
invited

crib
on
long
island
and
told
me
his
idea
for

i
thought
it

honor
to

with
him
but
i
told

i
also
producing

time
ol
dirty
bastard

to
his
house
a
lot
of
time
with
me
method
man
too
we
all
would
just
go
there
and
try
to
find
way
to
get
out
of
the
street
me
i
wa
trying
to
get
out
of
the
ghetto
paul
had
a
lot
of
respect
for
me
so
he
helped
me
break
out
of
it
i
think
he
liked
that
i
wa
so
dark
but
i
did
know
i
wa
dark
forever
saw
the
release
of
forever
the
clan
highly
anticipated
second
album
the
album
for
the
first
time
featured
rza
delegating
a
small
number
of
duty
to
other
producer
in
the
camp
such
a
his
protégés
mathematics
true
master
and
disciple
who
are
known
a
the
original
and
clan
member
inspectah
deck
gravediggaz
and
solo
project
round
two
during
the
period
rza
ceased
to
produce
every
solo
album
a
he
had
done
previously
but
continued
to
contribute
usually
one
or
two
song
on
average
to
each
record
a
well
a
receiving
an
executive
producer
credit
i
had
to
put
out
bobby
digital
instead
of
the
cure
because
if
i
did
do
that
i
would
suffered
two
thing
first
i
would
have
revealed
where
i
wa
musically
too
soon
is
the
perfect
medium
to
expose
anything
new
because
i
got
the
most
people
coming
together
to
buy
it
for
me
to
expose
it
for
my
own
self
i
do
think
that
would
been
a
wise
thing
for
me
to
do
i
might
caught
more
people
than
bobby
digital
caught
but
i
still
would
catch
the
magnitude
of
what
the
could
catch
maybe
this
year
or
next
year
the
game
may
be
different
the
cure
is
so
intimate
in
writing
that
you
got
ta
live
that
cure
shit
i
wa
living
like
bobby
digital
in
so
if
i
put
the
cure
out
then
i
would
even
be
able
to
get
on
stage
and
perform
it
for
ya
cause
i
be
lying
post
the
w
solo
project
in
the
rza
moved
into

film
score
his
first
work

praise

also
had
a
brief
cameo
in
the
film
itself
a
a
fellow
samurai
wearing
camouflage
the
experience
wa
positive
and
a
he
noted
during
an
interview
on
national
public
radio
fresh
air
the
work
with
traditional

him
the
desire
to
learn
how
to
read

write
music
in
he
david
goyer
blade
trinity
with
composer
ramin
djawadi
this
is
one
of
my
biggest
adventure
and
one
of
my
best
feeling
we
watched
kill
bill
in
manhattan
at
the
premiere
that
happened
but
you
know
that
hollywood
but
in
manhattan
a
theater

a
bunch
of
kid
coming
from
wherever
new
york
inside
a
movie
theater
and
the
movie
coming
on
they
do
even
know
that
i
the
man
with
the
music
and
when
it
said
original
music
by
the
rza
we
hear
the
audience
clapping
and
they
did
clap
for
nothing
else
because
the
movie
just
coming
on
i
wa
like
what
the
fuck
is
that
about
that
different
it
actually
might
be
something
special
you
never
care
who
did
that
once
you
see
who
star
in
the
shit
you
do
read
edited
you
do
read
all
that
you
be
eating
your
popcorn
and
it
go
right
by
you
but
for
somebody
to
see
that
and
then
clap
that
a
different
thing
right

pleasing

a
though
the

had
inhaled

several
producer
at
the
time
copied
the
style
creating
other
offshoot
west
ha
admitted
that
his
style
wa
distinctly
influenced
by
the
rza
production
saying
me
and
my
friend
talk
about
this
all
the
time
we
think
had
one
of
the
biggest
impact
a
far
a
a
movement
from
slang
to
style
of
dress
skit
the
sample
similar
to
the

style
i

rza
ha
been
doing
that
in

ha
spoken
quite
positively
of
the
comparison
all
good
i
got
super
respect
for
kanye
he
came
up
to
me
about
a
year

he
gave
me
mad
praising

one
of
the
biggest
artist
in

it
that
how
i
feel
about

his
bobby
digital
album
introduced
new
age
element
to
his
sound
these
have
incorporated
themselves
more
fully
into

such
a
method
man
the

after
the
way
i
produce
now
is
i
produce
more
like

rza
said
in
the

day
i
produced
more
like
a

i
did
understand
music
theory
at
all
now
that
i
do
understand
music
theory
i
make
my
music
more
playable
meaning
not
only
could
you
listen
to
it
you
could
get
someone
else
to
play
it
before
you
could
even
write
down
music
i
think
almost
percent
of
this
record
can
be
duplicated
by
a
band
which
is
important
for
music

that
mean
year
from
now
somebody
can
make
a
whole
song
out
of
it

cover
it
